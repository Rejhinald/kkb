# 📱 KKB (Kanya-Kanyang Bayad)

**KKB** is a lightweight, frontend-only web app that helps groups easily split bills by person.  
Enter the total amount, add people, assign individual orders, and instantly see how much each person needs to pay — no accounts, no backend, no hassle.

Built with **Next.js**, the app runs entirely on the client and uses **localStorage** to persist data across sessions.
